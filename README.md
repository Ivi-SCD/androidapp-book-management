# Android Book Management App

Status: In progress... ↻

The idea of this project came up in **[Alura's android learning experience](https://www.alura.com.br/formacao-android).** 
The project contains a basic CRUD in the book control app and knowledge of object orientation and design patterns. 
Good android and java development practices were applied (such as factory, DAO, etc..).

Some of applied techniques:
* `Activitites`
* `RelativeLayout`
* `LinearLayout`
* `Android Views`
  * `TextView`, `LisView`, `FloatingActionButton`, `EditText` and `Button`
* `Layered Architecture`
* `DAO pattern` and `Factory Pattern`
